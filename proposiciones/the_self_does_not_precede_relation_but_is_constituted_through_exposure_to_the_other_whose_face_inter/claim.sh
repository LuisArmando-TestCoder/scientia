deno run -A main.ts "The self does not precede relation but is constituted through exposure to the Other whose face interrupts my autonomy and resists objectification, for the face signifies a vulnerability that commands without coercion and invokes an infinite responsibility that is not chosen but assigned prior to any freedom, thereby reversing the primacy of ontology with ethics as first philosophy because the ethical relation emerges not from shared being but from radical alterity that escapes comprehension and totalization, placing the self in a state of obligation that cannot be balanced or completed and is fundamentally asymmetrical since the Other precedes me, calls me, accuses me, and takes me hostage, meaning that I am not sovereign but ethically bound beyond reciprocity, beyond justice, beyond law, and this responsibility is infinite because the Other is irreducible, their presence an epiphany that undoes my categories, demands care even in their silence, even in their threat, even in their persecution, such that my very subjectivity arises through this non-symmetric, non-dialectical relation where I am for-the-Other before I am for-myself, and thus ethics is not derived from the self but constitutes it, making the self’s very being a continual answer to the Other’s silent command."
