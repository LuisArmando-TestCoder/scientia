deno run -A main.ts "Complete awareness locked in into a daydream. One is brightness by locking into darkness (going into the rabbit hole - focus - compress - staring at the abyss), one is clarity by releasing awareness into light omnidirectionally (amplifying consciousness - enlightenment - release jumping into the abyss). So, if there is a false dichotomy between choosing a life of awareness and a life of flow state, and if both aren't mutually exclusive, then there could be a state of a simultaneous flow state enlightenment, complete awareness locked into a daydream. Treat “locking into darkness” and “releasing into light” as complementary attentional mechanics, not rival metaphysical camps. Deep focus compresses consciousness into a tight beam directed at a single meaning-rich locus—the “rabbit hole.” That compression prunes noise, amplifies signal, and yields the experiential intensity we label flow. Wide-angle clarity, by contrast, dilates attention until it becomes non-preferential, bathing all sensations in uniform salience; this is the phenomenology of mindfulness and the classical description of enlightenment. Both operations act on the same substrate—attentional allocation—and both obey the same underlying energy budget: sustained focus demands metabolic efficiency, which compression supplies, while omnidirectional awareness requires the freedom from local prediction. In practice, the nervous system oscillates between these modes all the time (micro-saccades in vision, task switching in cognition, inhalation and exhalation), so the presumed dichotomy is more a linguistic artifact than a biological barrier. When the oscillation rate approaches continuity—compression and dilation interpenetrating with no perceptible gap—the mind can belong wholly to the unfolding task while registering the total field of experience at the same time. This hybrid is what Zen calls mushin and modern psychology glimpses in expert performers whose situational awareness remains panoramic even as their execution is focalized. Thus a “flow-state enlightenment” is not a contradiction but the logical end-point of unifying the two native attentional drives: perfect absorption that is perfectly transparent to itself, a lucid daydream in which nothing important escapes notice and nothing noticed obstructs the flow."
