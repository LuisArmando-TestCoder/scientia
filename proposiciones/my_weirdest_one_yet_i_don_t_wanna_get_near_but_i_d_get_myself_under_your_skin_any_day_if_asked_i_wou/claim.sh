deno run -A main.ts "My weirdest one yet, I don't wanna get near, but I'd get myself under your skin any day. 

If asked, I would reject, but if needed; to ask? No need.

I resist with reason, but surrender with instinct.

I can only do like humans do with cats, detached from expectations, with open arms, for them to come and go at any time, but it lingers every time, innit? That analogy falls apart; cats don't break hearts like you do.

Fracture; freedom; I'm poisoned as I nurture. Freedom isn't repression, but I'm held hostage, and if I speak up, I rupture.

My due is spacious, accepting, and unconditional, and yet, I would be a liar if I didn't tell you, this secrecy is hurting, this passivity is aching, but this is the price of (not like I think is right, but like is right to) surrender. I surrender to restraint, I surrender in the name of freedom, I lie to myself in the name of truth, and so then, only then, I will know that what you feel for me is true, for I'm afraid to break you, but if I were to, I would do what I really want, for what I really want is to hold you."
