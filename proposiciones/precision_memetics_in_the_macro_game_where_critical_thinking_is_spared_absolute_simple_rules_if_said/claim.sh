In the macro game, where critical thinking is spared, absolute simple rules, if said wrongly, can corrupt the bigger picture.

It depends on the person — sometimes you need to talk to the crowd, some others to the decision makers, some others to the reality benders. The fact that many people value simplicity and detest pseudo-intellectual sounding nuances doesn’t mean that you need to discard nuances. Like when pills are advertised with a disclaimer below, hard to read, hard to swallow. Is it ok to obscure the nuances? Healthcare seems to be having a blast with it.

If the power of the masses is too scattered to make use of, then trying to make use of it is energetically less efficient than garnering the leverage of the reality benders.

In the macro game, saying the right words in the wrong way compounds the wrong doings of the absolutists, for they misunderstand compoundingly (sometimes knowingly).

I don’t need everybody to understand, but the right ones… my targets. So it's not just about simplifying stuff, is about choosing wisely how to simplify it."
