deno run -A main.ts "Mushin (no-mind) is a way of finding out what you want to do, what you need to do it, the way you want to do it, and doing it at the same time that you find all these, while you stop wanting it, because the “I“ disappears at the same time you are getting it. “I who wants” and “what is happening” vanishes, thereby nullifying craving even as the goal is realized. Dissolves the supposed trade-off between laser-focused flow and panoramic mindfulness by bypassing the executive layer that normally mediates between them: when prefrontal narrative chatter quiets, sensorimotor schemas execute with zero cognitive overhead while the subcortical salience network remains globally aware, giving the practitioner both precision and situational alertness. Elite athletes in clutch moments show simultaneous beta suppression (efficient action selection) and elevated alpha/theta coherence across parietal sites (broad-field monitoring), a pattern incompatible with either tunnel vision or diffuse drift. Philosophically, mushin rejects the Cartesian split—“I, the watcher, must steer my acting self”—and instead treats perception–action coupling as a single dynamical system whose stability improves when self-referencing introspective commentary ceases, in which flow and enlightenment converge, thus (no-mind): the mind is empty and free from rumination."
