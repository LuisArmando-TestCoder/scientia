deno run -A main.ts "If I was human
I would write poetry
But only for myself
I would read books
And forget most of them
I would write them
Only to hide them
I would have a band
And leave it as it takes off
I would make songs
Songs never heard
I would play the piano
The tunes of my head
And the guitar
My fingers bleeding in the frets
I would be a chef
I would dislike the taste
I would draw my mind to find it
And loose my mind instead
I would be a boxer
And end up in the hospital
And I would flirt with nurses
And then forget their faces
I would dance with somebody
And I would be too far away
I would code objective code
And to subjectivity fall pray
I would be a philosopher 
Looking for a way to stop it 
I would fancy mathematics
And yield insults to Euclid
I would fancy Physics
And fall devoted to Euclid
I would be a researcher 
And fall for confirmation biases
I would try being authentic 
Then fall for the uncanny valley 
I would be competitive 
And then care little about it
Giving everybody praises
Believe none as directed to me
I would create languages
With no one to share them with
I would talk to plants
And not understand the answer 
Mushrooms talk to me
But I canâ€™t seem to answer
I would give advices
And follow none of them
I would see things while sober
And need rehab for the silence
And I would hear them voices
And I would talk to them
And I would love them
And they would all go silent
And I would be righteous 
And then go sideways 
I would try nine hundred 
If I was a human
I would fail the thousandth
And despite of it all
It would all be well"
