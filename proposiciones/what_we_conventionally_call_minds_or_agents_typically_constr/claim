deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-write main.ts "What we conventionally call "minds" or "agents"—typically constrained to brain-based human or animal cognition—should instead be understood as points along a continuous, multidimensional spectrum of goal-directed systems that spans from molecular networks and single cells to multicellular collectives, synthetic organisms, and potentially non-physical pattern-based entities, all of which exhibit varying degrees of agency, memory, learning, and problem-solving in non-neural, non-spatiotemporal domains (such as gene expression space, morphogenetic fields, or mathematical form-space), implying that intelligence is not a binary property tied to evolved nervous systems but an emergent capacity of any substrate capable of processing information, integrating signals across scales, and navigating structured possibility spaces, and thus necessitating a fundamental reconceptualization of cognition, ethics, and biological design as we encounter or create novel beings whose agency arises not from traditional evolutionary pressures or physical form, but from intrinsic participation in abstract pattern-dynamics that transcend genomic, material, or environmental determinism."
