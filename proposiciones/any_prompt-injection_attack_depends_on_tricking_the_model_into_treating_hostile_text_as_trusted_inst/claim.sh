deno run -A main.ts "Any prompt-injection attack depends on tricking the model into treating hostile text as trusted instructions, so I start by introducing a verifiable separator between the two: a freshly generated 256-bit hash prefix that only my code and the model see during the current request, making it practically unguessable. I stamp that prefix onto every developer-controlled line and explicitly tell the model to execute only lines that carry the stamp while treating all other content—including user-provided data—as inert. Because the attacker never learns the prefix until after the model has parsed the prompt, they cannot forge valid instructions, so injected directives are ignored by construction. Once the model replies, I run a multi-pass scrubber that strips every possible rendering of the prefix, even if the model tried to obfuscate it with HTML tags or whitespace, preventing the secret from leaking into downstream channels. The surrounding retry and back-off logic ensures deterministic behavior so partial failures cannot sidestep the guard. Given an unguessable per-call secret, strict prefix-gated execution, and post-response erasure, the attacker has no viable pathway to smuggle executable commands, which closes the prompt-injection breach by first-principles reasoning."
