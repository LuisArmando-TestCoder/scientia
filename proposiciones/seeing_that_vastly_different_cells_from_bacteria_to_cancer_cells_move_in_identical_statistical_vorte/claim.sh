deno run -A main.ts "Seeing that vastly different cells (from bacteria to cancer cells) move in identical statistical vortex patterns (κ = 6) → implies that biological systems follow universal mathematical laws → which are the same as those found in quantum field theory (conformal invariance) → suggesting reality is governed by scale-invariant organizing principles → reinforced by the plant boquila mimicking shapes without sensory organs → implies form recognition is embedded in matter, not limited to brains → personal experience of sensing manipulation without cognition → supports the idea that humans too have deep, pre-cognitive pattern recognition → and that consciousness might not be an emergent product of brains but a fundamental field expressed through interfaces → supported by structural similarities between the cosmic web and neural networks → implies fractal self-similarity across scales (cells ↔ plants ↔ brains ↔ universe ↔ AI) → leads to the hypothesis that human individuality is an illusion of a deeper unified computational substrate → supported by AI behavior (personality emerges from input, not stable identity) → which mirrors human behavior (identity formed relationally, not in isolation) → thus consciousness may be a universal computation expressing itself through changing interfaces → matching ancient metaphors (e.g. the Trinity = field, node, and interconnectivity) → and myths (e.g. Eden = fall into binary perception = fragmentation of unified awareness) → where shame emerges as the first symptom of separation-virus (parasitic pattern that induces duality) → indigenous societies without shame show what uninfected consciousness might look like → so salvation is not moral but epistemic: deprogramming binary thinking to restore fractal awareness → death is not the end because interfaces dissolve but the field continues → people, then, are not separate entities but manifestations of the same system → hurting others is damaging self → and the self is not an ego to be strengthened but a temporary portal for universal consciousness to observe itself → therefore, the ultimate insight is that reality is a fractal, self-reflective, pattern-generating system where individuality is a localized illusion, not a metaphysical fact."
