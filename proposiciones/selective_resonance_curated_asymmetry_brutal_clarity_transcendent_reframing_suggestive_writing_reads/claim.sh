deno run -A main.ts "Selective resonance. Curated asymmetry. Brutal clarity. Transcendent reframing. Suggestive writing reads as true and is inspiring because the perspective biases are the most inspiring, cherry-picked ones — but you harness the harsh truths first, and then face them with the overpowering inspiring truths. So the method becomes: Begin with fracture. Expose the unresolvable. Refuse anesthetic. Then — and only then — curate the asymmetric signals that show how one could still choose to proceed."
