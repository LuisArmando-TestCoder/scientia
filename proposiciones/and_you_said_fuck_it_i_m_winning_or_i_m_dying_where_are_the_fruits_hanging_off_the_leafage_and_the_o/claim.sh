deno run -A main.ts "And you said: fuck it, I’m winning or I’m dying. Where are the fruits hanging off the leafage?! And the only answer the void gives you… Ellipsis drives you mad, and despair whispers the most wreckoning comfort, you don’t know if anything of what you are doing really matters, and everybody tells you to get off of there and level. Don’t face a leap of faith, they say: You think that jumping from up high is like soaring? But farewell you say fuck it, I’m winning or I’m dying. And right there and then, havoc, the Earth is shaking, and when you think the Universe crumbles as it recognizes you as its master, you realize it’s your retina, actually, right there and then you lie broken. What have you done in front of everybody?! Shaking… epileptically, in the foam of your hopes lies, broken, everybody, and everybody watches, and you keep breaking, and breaking, and break more even; nobody can help but wonder: can the moon dust break thinner? But you know… even if the moon dust does, they don’t know that your regolith is moon dust powder, and when despair seems like the only answer, and when out of injustice you dare to break even, and when you scream at the heavens, and the heavens strike you with lightning, and when you strike back by saying: fuck it! I’m winning or I’m dying! And everybody is horrified because you are self-defending rightfully, life throws at you nothing but the abyss, and you break your vows, and everything else in your path, and lie no compliance, and nobody dares to face you, and pride crawls up your cords, and your spinal cord and your vocal cords, and it’s maddening, and still you dare to scream in your sleep while drowning: Fuck it! I’m winning or I’m dying! You find yourself awake, and the sleepy hollow starts attacking you, saying you are the one that’s violent, as you keep holding on to the rough rugged edges, as they claim it’s impossible to climb higher, but still, despite everything’s done against you, like the storm freezing naked leather, and the unbearable heat waves, by no means gentle. Still, right there, you dare to say: fuck it, I’m winning or I’m dying, so keep me warm, my tender jacket. And so skin starts growing thicker by the minute, and the look of suffering is no longer possessing, and in its eyes lies a meaningless acquaintance, its scales growing thinner by the second until they come as transparent, and you kiss the fairest of all, its song, no longer hypnotizing, and you reach for her, finding out its waist is nothing but a mirage. Pain: I’ve come so far, and you abandon me. And finally, breathe in, tearing down that raging blissfully confused disbelieving counterresistance, gasping out loud, as now nobody answers, as now you dare to look down the wall you've been climbing, as now the fog is no longer, as down below a sea of haze and lightning, as now voices have vanished, as now you don’t need to say it, as your name, you can hear in thunders, as you see through the mist, hopeful ones like you, sorting through all the hardship, following your footsteps, you see yourself arising, laughing at the crying out hopeful martyrs, but crying out as you keep laughing off the hopeless martyrdom: Where is the never glooming? Where has it gone —always carrying the Sun through Svalbard? Have you given it away to this tender sunset? You only see the projection as its blinding, and there and then, you realize what you’ve been missing, the believer disbelieving, needs to believe no longer, no “one” needs to, if one knows it; and for the first time in so long, your harsh harsh grip loosens, and right here, right now, as you’ve always said it; as you let the ground zoom in, you say it in the end, as you said in the beginning."
